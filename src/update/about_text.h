# About Haven Tools

Haven tools is a resource for viewing and extracting Dragon Age: Origins .erf files. It currently supports viewing and extracting models, textures, materials, and animations, and listening to audio for the core game and it's DLC's.

You can navigate through the files by clicking through the .erf's in the menu. Models and meshes are contained in modelmeshdata.erf.

You can also design, or re-design, a custom character by going in to the Character Designer.

Most of the features in this program are WIP and subject to change.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or bugs to report, either leave a comment on the NexusMods page, or raise an issue in the issue tracker on the GitHub page.

### Credits

- Eshme. Her DAOTools plugin for 3dsmax was the launching point, as I have been able to use it to understand the models and meshes.
- DAO Tools wiki. Allowed me to write Gff decryption quickly.
